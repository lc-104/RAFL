'Algorithm.R' file contains the main functions we used to implement our RAFL method, 
it includes functions for Algorithms 1, 2, and 3.

'Simulation p50.R' file contains the codes used to run the simulation study Example 1 under all three scenarios.

'Tables and graphs.R' contains the codes used to produce the tables and plots in our simulation study.

To reproduce the simulation results as we show in the manuscript, please run 'Simulation p50.R' first 
and save the results using the last line of code, then produce plots and tables using 'Tables and graphs.R'.
